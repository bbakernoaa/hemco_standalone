hemco_standalone
================

This is the HEMCO standalone model code. The HEMCO source code (github/com/christophkeller/hemco/) is included as a subtree
so that modifications can be freely synchronized.
Installation requires links to the GEOS-Chem netCDF libraries. An example Makefile that includes automatic download of HEMCO and
the GEOS-Chem netCDF library can be found at github.com/christophkeller/hemco_standalone_full.
